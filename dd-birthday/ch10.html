    	<span class="text"> It became somewhat of an inside joke that I would bet you that you wouldn’t ask me out before the school year ended. As discussed before we had decided that we wouldn’t start dating at least until next fall, so I always took your response as a joke. One fateful day, the day before my showcase for Urban, we had a really long practice, and afterward, I asked if you wanted to hang out for a bit since I was really close to Manzi anyway. You said yes, and eventually I showered and showed up to your place with a salad and bread knots from dominos. After I ate, I laid in your bed, you joined me, and we watched episodes of The Good Place together. You were a little on edge because it was hell week for you, and you had to be on call until 6 am, but we cuddled and some stuff happened that I don’t really remember, but finally you said the words “I want you to be my girlfriend.” I still had a little bit of apprehension because I had been in a long distance relationship before with a really bad outcome, but your confidence in us really made me feel like it was going to work out. Of course I said okay and that was it: we were dating and you won the bet. <br></span>
        <span class="text"> <br>A lot of other things happened that night, and although I would love to recollect all of them for you, so much happened in the next 24 hours that it would be too much for me to go into detail about them. But in case you forget, here’s a short list: we did a lot of shit and your rice purity score dropped by about 18, ironically Kelly Yu was the first one to find out we were dating, I gave you a huge ass hickey right before your crossing and accidentally exposed you to your pledge class, you became power pledge which was such a turn on, I had my dance thing, you had your crossing party, you drunk called me about 50 times, I ditched my urban party to come celebrate with you, apparently we made out but none of us remember, and we walked home and cuddled for the second night in a row. It really is quite amazing how much we did in less than a day, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. You were now officially mine, and for once in my life, I didn't want anything to change. <br></span>
