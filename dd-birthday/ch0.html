    	<span class="text"> This story might be a bit boring, but I promise it's short and has a pretty good payoff (like 3 chapters later). So back in Fall 2018, I was really interested in joining the professional engineering fraternity (you might have heard of it) call Theta Tau, or TT short. Naturally, being the ✨dedicated✨ person I am, I went to all the rush events, where one fateful day I met this nerdy Asian guy. Let's call him Destin. <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> It was day two of rush, speed dating, where unfortunately I had to SHARE an active with Destin. Now I emphasize SHARE because yo girl not too good at SHARing. Even when it's speed dating for professional reasons, yo girl get jealous because she loves ✨attention✨. So when I had to speed date Sungin with this DeSTiN boi, I yelled at him for stealing MY spotlight.<br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> Long story short none of us got a bid because we were both too obnoxious, but that just gave us the opportunity to have our paths cross once again with all the ✨endless✨ ✨possibilities✨ in the ✨universe✨. (Super cheesey. I know. But trust it's worth to stay till the end).<br><br></span>
