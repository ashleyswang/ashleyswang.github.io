        <center> <h1 class="title">Chapter 5: Drinking Together</h1></center>
    	<span class="text"> This one’s a little short, but I feel like it was memorable enough to warrant its own chapter. I don’t even remember why we were hanging out that night, but it was probably along the lines of me being lonely because my roommate wasn’t in town. I remember asking Sayali to get us alc and then going to IV Deli Mart to get chase because we’re both ✨weak✨ af, and we both got hella intrigued by this CBD infused water (that I ended up throwing away since it actually tasted like ass.)  When we got home we popped open a bottle of wine and drank some Angry Orchard, and you took advantage of drunk Ashley and somehow convinced me to watch a scary movie with you.   <br></span>
        <br>
    	<span class="text"> <br> The movie wasn’t even that scary but you tried to scare me like three separate times. I was also being a little bitch and paused the movie anytime the tension was building up or I was annoyed at the main protagonist for being stupid. You laughed at my overreactions and I kept drinking because I fucking hate scary movies and I needed a distraction. But I realize now the reason why I put up with it is because I really enjoyed spending time with you. By the end of the movie I was basically wasted, so you tucked me in, turned off the lights and left. As I drifted off, I thought about our incredible friendship and I really appreciated every second I got to spend with you — until you busted into my room as I was about to fall asleep and woke me up just to ask me what to do about locking the door, stupid.  <br><br></span>
