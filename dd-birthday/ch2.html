    	<span class="text"> Deltopia weekend: crazy day. I asked you to come along but since you're antisocial and hate meeting people, you stayed home and drank without me. I, however, got wasted in an attempt to forget my sorrows and while super drunk, decided to randomly FaceTime you to solidify hot pot plans we had made earlier in the week (that was just an excuse to talk to you though, but you knew probably knew that already).  <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> You made the mistake of picking up my no-warning FaceTime call since now I knew that you were willing to give me ✨attention✨. BIG MISTAKE. Soon random drunk calls and last minute hot-pot friend dates were really common. On our friend dates — emphasis on the ✨friend✨ — we talked (or I talked while you listened and probably thought "wow you're so dumb") about our school, our interests, whatever came to mind and bonded over things like our GPAs and sad boi hours. <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> It was at this moment that I realized that I really cared about you and I hoped we would be in each others lives for hopefully a long time. (Ugh so sappy I know.) I really enjoyed your company, and it was nice having a friend who I could trust with nearly everything. I would always leave our friend dates feeling not-so-anxious and annoying you by singing 童话 on the car was just the udon cherry on top of the hot pot cake. <br><br></span>
