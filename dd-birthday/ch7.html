    	<span class="text"> At this point, most of our hang outs were limited to the Goleta area, so one day, we decided to watch Avengers: Endgame together since you hadn’t watched it yet and I’m a sucker for Marvel taking my money. For one reason or another (I think it’s because I thought there would be a huge line for it), we went super early and had to kill like three hours downtown. I shopped for some really cute mugs and you really wanted to go to the comic book store.<br></span>
        <span class="text"> <br>At first I didn’t really think much of it, and since I had never actually been to a comic book store, I was interested in going, but once we got there. Oh. My. God. This place was exactly like the comic book stores on TV. Boxes filled with different comic books, nerds playing D&D in the corner, and action figures every where. I followed you around for a bit, but eventually I got lost and started looking at laptop stickers at the front. About 20 minutes later, you showed up with a massive pile of comic book in your hands with a huge nerd grin on your face, and I laughed because finally your full nerdiness was on display. Later we got ice cream, and you texted Mason to tag along. <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> Mason thought something was up, but since both of us are oblivious to things, we were like “No man. You’re crazy.” and we watched Endgame together. I cried when Black Widow and Iron Man died and of course you laughed at me, and I made us sit through 5 minutes of credits just so I could hear the special iron man sound at the end of the movie. Afterwards, we hung outside of our cars and talked about summer plans and internships. Overall it was a pretty fun night, and that night I saw the true nerd boi that I know and love now. I drove you home, and then probably drank after. That was the story of our unofficial first date that Mason now makes fun of me for all the time.   <br><br></span>
