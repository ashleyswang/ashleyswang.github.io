    	<span class="text"> One of my worst qualities is that I am a ✨huge✨ procrastinator, and I honestly should have known better than to take four fucking CS classes in a quarter, but of course, ya girl really thought she could do it (spoiler alert: she couldn’t). One night, when I was trying to finish homework I procrastinated on, I got super lonely and texted you. We started texting while I was desperately drawing random circle diagrams trying to figure out DFAs. Eventually, texting was taking too much brain power (I’m not very good at multitasking) so I asked if you would be down to FaceTime while I did my homework (to keep me company n stuff) so I could still use my hands to draw diagrams and talk to you at the same time. <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> We ended up FaceTiming until 3 am, something I hadn’t done for a while, and I remember brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed in front of you while we probably laughed at some stupid shit (probably my indistinguishable mumbling). Even though we didn’t talk a lot during the call since both of us had a fuck ton of work to do, I remember that just having your presence around made me feel all ✨warm✨ inside. But I needed to go to bed, so we said good night, and that night I fell asleep with a smile on my face. <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> At this point, I had accepted that any time I had for a man had been replaced by CS, but even though I was practically dating my computer, a little part of me couldn’t help but like you just a little more than I did before. Even if none of us knew it then, that night you had planted the seeds to your evil trap. I really thought I could ignore the feelings and nothing would happen. So dumb. But I’ll get to that part later. <br><br></span>
