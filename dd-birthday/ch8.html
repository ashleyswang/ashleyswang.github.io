    	<span class="text"> Finally it was my birthday, Historically my birthday hasn’t been great. People who I thought cared about me would forget, parents would get into fights, other bad past experiences had led to me to believe that birthdays were just never gonna be my thing, but this year, I had a better feeling about it. I got a fuck ton of alcohol and a cheap Albertsons cake, and invited only my closest friends over to drink with me. Starting at about 6 or 7 pm, I had taken shot after shot while my CS group was were on our project, but after they left, some of my best friends finally showed up and wanted to hang with me. One of these friends was you. <br></span>
        <span class="text"> <br>I opened the door and you handed me a Sephora bag, and when I said “I told you not to get me anything,” you response was short and sweet: “Get fucked.” I smiled because you were one of the only people who knew how I felt about my birthday, and even though I was okay with, you made effort to make this year not a repeat of the last few. You stayed with me and Julia while we just chilled at my place, but with Julia being occupied with something else, we started watching A Dog’s Purpose and Julia left because “she was tired”. (Side note: Julia later told me that it was because she knew we liked it other and felt really uncomfortable but I swear at this point I still didn’t know how I felt.) We moved to the couch and finally. Finally. We cuddled. <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br>You put your arm around me and I held your hand. Finally all of the anxiety about feelings being reciprocated went away. All of butterflies made sense, and I knew that I definitely liked you. There was no doubt. You had been my rock all quarter and you were the person who made me the happiest, and I'm really glad to have spent my birthday with the one person who brings so much positivity into my life, no matter the circumstance.<br><br></span>
