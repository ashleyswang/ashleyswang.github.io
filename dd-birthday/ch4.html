    	<span class="text1">So here we have another master procrastinator Ashley story: I think this was the same week that we had homework FaceTimed, and I had become really sick from the lack of sleep catching up to me, but unfortunately yo girl ‚ú®procrastinated‚ú® ‚ú®again‚ú® (ha do we really expect anything different at this point) and was grinding it out Sunday morning at Julia‚Äôs house. <br></span>
    	<span class="text1"> <br> She was having some personal issues with her fam, and I didn‚Äôt want to get caught in the middle of it, so naturally I texted you telling you about my situation while she was in her room dealing with it. I was completely fucked for my lab, I‚Äôm terrible at emotional support, and I was literally dying because my body hates me. But luckily I had you to encouraged me on the lab and gave me good advice on dealing with emotions. Probably the thing I most grateful for ‚Äî you brought me Tylenol and whole ass gallon of water.  <br></span>
        <br>
        <center><img src="./media/IMG_9781.JPG" height="30%" width="30%"></center>
    	<span class="text1"> <br> When you came, you comforted Julia and gave me my medicine. It was a short interaction in a pretty long day, but I knew I could count on you. Anytime I wasn‚Äôt taking care of myself (it‚Äôs literally just be being lazy most of the time too), you were the first one to offer me help. Anytime I was lonely, you were there to keep me company. And anytime I needed someone to talk to, you were there. (Wow I‚Äôm totally noticing this makes our relationship seem hella one sided but it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm really needy) I think this is when I started noticing feelings for you, but as we know, what does Ashley do when she feels things? She üëèpushes üëèthem üëèdown. <br><br></span>
