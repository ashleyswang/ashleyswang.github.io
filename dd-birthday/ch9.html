    	<span class="text"> A few days after my birthday, you came over to hang out and we wanted to finish watching a dog movie. I was kinda anxious because I didn’t know if the couch cuddle only happened because I was drunk or because you actually liked me back. But a few minutes into watching, I found my head on your shoulder again with our hands interlinking, and I was even more confused than before. <br></span>
        <span class="text"> <br>We finished watching the movie and laid in my bed again, but this time instead of avoiding each other, I rested my head on your chest which you wrapped your arms around me. I finally asked you what exactly this was, and the overall consensus was that we liked each other, but you had some things to figure out and starting a relationship at this point in the school year would be a bad idea. <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br>I was a little sad, of course, because it took a lot for me to admit that I had feelings for you, but it was okay because I genuinely enjoyed our friendship and that was more important to me than anything else. I was content with where we were at, and I planned to continue our friendship as normal. <br><br></span>
