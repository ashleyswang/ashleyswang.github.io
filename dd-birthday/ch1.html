        <center><h1>Chapter 1: Rushing Part 2</h1></center>
    	<span class="text"> (TBH this part is also kinda boring but it was the catalyst to our ✨friendship✨ so I felt the need to include it.) So fast forward 7 months and TT was having their annual spring rush. I showed up and OF COURSE nerd boi Destin was there. Naturally since I have zero social skills, I talked to the people that I knew and I guess Destin kinda counted, so I mostly spent the entire time annoying the fuck out of him.  <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> Pro-dev night came, and I wore the exact same outfit as last time because apparently I don’t own business casual clothing. Destin struts in (you know the way he does with ✨pep✨ in his ✨step✨) and we talk a little. Since I’m kinda short but I like to believe that I’m tall, I challenged him with my heels but he was still taller than me so I just a little salty. And then rest of rush happened... yada yada yada (tbh this part is also boring so Imma skip ahead) ... you know the drill.<br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> I honestly was a little off my game and that night I get the email that I didn’t get an invite to the barbecue. But after spending another 2 days with this Destin boy, we had become somewhat decent friends and I wanted to make sure this time we actually stayed in touch (unlike last time) so I asked for his number. Over the next few days or so, I checked in because I really wanted him to get a bid (which he did because he’s actually perfect) and so we talked more frequently and our friendship ✨blossomed✨.<br><br></span>
