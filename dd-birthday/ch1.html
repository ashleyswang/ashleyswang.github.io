    	<span class="text"> (TBH this part is also kinda boring but it was the catalyst to our ✨friendship✨ so I felt the need to include it.) So fast forward 7 months and TT was having their annual spring rush. I showed up and OF COURSE you showed up. Naturally since I have zero social skills, I talked to the people that I knew and I guess you kinda counted, so I mostly spent the entire time annoying the fuck out of you.  <br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> Pro-dev night came, and I wore the exact same outfit as last time because apparently I don’t own business casual clothing. I watched as you strutted in (you know the really cute way you do with a little ✨pep✨ in your ✨step✨) and we talked a bit. Since I’m kinda short but I like to believe that I’m tall, I challenged you with my heels but you were still taller than me. Yeah I'm still a little salty. And then rest of rush happened... yada yada yada (tbh this part is also boring so imma skip ahead) ... you know the drill.<br></span>
    	<span class="text"> <br> I didn’t get a bid, but after spending another 2 days with you, we had become somewhat decent friends and I wanted to ✨continue the friendship✨ so I asked for your number, and from there our friendship ✨blossomed✨.<br><br></span>
